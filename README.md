# Data-structure-Visualization
Stack and Queue Visualization
This project is a frontend application designed to visualize operations on fundamental data structures: Stack and Queue. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, it allows users to interact with these structures in real-time by performing essential operations such as:

Push and Pop for the Stack
Insert and Delete for the Queue
The application offers a clean and intuitive interface that helps users understand how these operations affect the underlying data structures. It serves as an educational tool for learning data structure concepts in a visual and interactive way.
