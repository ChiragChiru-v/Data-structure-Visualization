# Data-structure-Visualization
<h3>Stack and Queue Visualization</h3>

This project is a frontend application designed to visualize operations on fundamental data structures: Stack and Queue. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, it allows users to interact with these structures in real-time by performing essential operations such as:
<ul>
<li>Push and Pop for the Stack</li>
<li>Insert and Delete for the Queue</li>
</ul>
The application offers a clean and intuitive interface that helps users understand how these operations affect the underlying data structures. It serves as an educational tool for learning data structure concepts in a visual and interactive way.
